# A Polymer.dart Test Sampler

I am struggling with the new [test](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/test) library when applied to Polymer. This is a collection of simple unit tests with the goal of identifying the simplest cases upon which I can build (or submit bug reports).

This is primary supporting my efforts with [Patterns in Polymer](http://patternsinpolymer.com). You should check it out if you haven't already.

## Install and Usage

You need the latest Dart. Then run `pub install` and then the various bin scripts will execute the appropriate `pub run test` arguments.
